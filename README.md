# WENDy (Weak-form Estimation of Nonlinear Dynamics) in Python

Implementation of WENDy in Python, featuring automated critical radius selection for optimal parameters recovery.

WENDy is a forward-solver-free algorithm for estimating parameters in differential equations using the weak form. See https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10002818/ for details about WENDy.  This repository contains code accompanying the paper:
